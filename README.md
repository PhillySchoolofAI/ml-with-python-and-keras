## Machine learning with Keras

Worked examples following _Deep Learning with Python_ by Fran√ßois Chollet
It's an amazing [book](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) - likely the fastest way to get started with _machine learning_!

Source code from the book available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks)
